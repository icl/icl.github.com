    This course centers around the assignments.  Lectures exist to go over material that you will need to know to do a good job on the assignments.  The material you find online here in the form of lectures does not conform closely to what happens in class, where the focus will be on examples and critique of sites.  Above all this course is about developing 'good taste' in web site design.  This means knowing what makes a site work and what weakens its usability.  The principles you learn here generalize to interface design more broadly.   In today's class we will go over some of the main content areas we will be covering in the class.

  <h1>How to Submit Assignments </h1>
</div>

  <div class="span4">
    <h2>Individual Assignments</h2>
  </div>
  <div class="span12">
    <ol>
      <li>    Once you've completed your assignment, log onto your class
    account. From the main page, click  on the assignment due date and
    you will see a "Submit" link in the day window.  If today is the due
    date you will see that little link automatically.  Alternatively you
    can use the SUBMIT label in the right hand drawer of this page.  If
    you have <strong>Java Runtime Environment installed</strong> - which on most
    computers is automatically installed you will see a JAVA applet icon
    telling you that it is loading.  It may take 10-15 seconds before
    that icon appears and another 10-20 seconds before it fully
    installs.
    </li>
    <li>
      Once the applet has loaded you will see a directory structure that
      allows you to drag all your files into the window to upload your
      files.  <strong>Using your computers own file manager</strong> (called 'window explorer' on PC's and 'Finder' on Macs) find the files and sub directories you want to submit. Be sure that your index.htm or index.html file is at the top level.  Drag all these over.  You should see them upload.  If your files are very large you will see a upload meter showing your progress.   Once uploaded all your files and sub-folders should appear in the java directory. 
      </li>
      <li>
To check that everything was submitted correctly - and to make sure that
your links are working - click on the index file. <strong> If you get a
  null it is probably because you have set your browser to block all
  popups.</strong>  You need to go to your options or preferences and
unblock <strong>adrenaline.ucsd.edu</strong>.  On the  PC go to
<strong>Tools>Options>Content then choose Allowed Sites</strong> and
type in adrenaline.ucsd.edu.  On MACS go to
<strong>Firefox>Preferences>Content</strong> then choose Allowed Sites.  Once you have unblocked popups clicking on your index page will open a new browser.  But the page you first see may say something else.  So you may have to look for the popped up browser since it may be behind another browser.  
      
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
    Remember, every time you re-submit an assignment, the timestamp will
    change andoverwrite any previous submission time record. The graders
    use the latest listed timestamp to determine if the assignment was
    submitted on time so make sure you submit a little earlier in case
    you have to modify anything.</p>
  </div>
</div>
<div class="row">
  <div class="span4">
    <h2>Team Assignments</h2>
  </div>
  <div class="span12">
    <p>Only one person per team needs to submit the assignment. All
    class accounts within a team are tied to a single team account. Once
    a team-member submits an assignment, the other team members will
    automatically be included in the submission record.</p>

    <p>Remember, for team assignments, each individual must also send
    an e-mail to the RA/TA/IA with theirpersonal group evaluation (see
    below).</p>
    <p>Once you've completed your assignment, the designated submitter
    should log onto their class account. From the main page, click on
    "ASSIGNMENT", then "Submit Assignment". On the resulting page, make
    sure the assignment you want to turn is the currently listed item in
    the dropdown list. Click "Next" and you should have a java applet
    open which allows you to simply drag all your files into the window
    to upload your files.</p>
    <p>Once you've dragged all your files into the window, click "Next"
    and you should get a confirmation screen. Make sure you check over
    your files to ensure that everything was submitted correctly.</p>
    <p>Remember, every time you re-submit an assignment, the timestamp
    will change and overwrite any previous submission time record. The
    graders use the latest listed timestamp to determine if the
    assignment was submitted on time so make sure you submit a little
    earlier in case you have to modify anything.</p>
